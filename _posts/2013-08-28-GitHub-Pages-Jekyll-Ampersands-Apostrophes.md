Why am I getting this "page build failed" error on my GitHub Pages checkin? I have been asking myself that question lately.
I've been migrating my blog into GitHub Pages, but haven't taken the time to setup Ruby and Jekyll on my 
Windows 7 dev machine. [GitHub Pages Help recommends running the Jekyll build locally](https://help.github.com/articles/pages-don-t-build-unable-to-run-jekyll#syntax-errors) 
to troubleshoot these errors, but the ["official documentation does not support installation on Windows platforms"](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
