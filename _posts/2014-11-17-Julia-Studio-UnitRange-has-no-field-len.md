Are you getting flacky behavior from Julia Studio? I did. I'm on Windows 8.1 and every time I tried to run a jl script it either would do nothing, 
or I would get the error in the title of this post (and maybe the script would run). If I reset the console via the Tools &gt; Julia &gt; Reset Console menu item
I could usually get another execution out of the debugger. The Julia Studio Console didn't seem to work with REPL commands either. 

It looks like there is a bug in the ConsoleLogic.jl script that comes with Julia Studio 0.4.5. I seem to have fixed my issue by editing the ConsoleLogic.jl 
script on line 210 to change range.len to be <strike>range.length</strike> length(range). Apparently the correct <strike>property is length</strike> approach is a method call (not len property).

See the following link under the General Collections header for the documenation: [http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/](http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/)

I have not found a blog or stackoverflow article on this yet so I thought I would share my experience.

I had to run Notepad as administrator in order to edit the ConsoleLogic.jl since it resides in the Program Files area. You can do this by clicking 
the Start button &gt; typing Notepad (don't push enter) &gt; right click on the Notepad search result &gt; select Run as administrator. Then browse to the ConsoleLogic.jl file. 
My was under C:\Program Files\JuliaStudio-0.4.5\julia-studio\share\julia-studio\Console\ConsoleLogic.jl but the error message in Julia Studio will tell you where yours is.
