In this post I'm continuing the theme of sharing my work in the CUNY Master of Science, Data Analytics program. As part of my final project during
the Fall 2014 semester, I acquired and analyzed [Natality (birth) data from the U.S. Deparment of Health and Human Services (HHS)](http://wonder.cdc.gov/natality-current.html) 
in combination with [Unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) to discover possible relationships.

The time frame of the data sets was between 2007 and 2012, which includes the so called "Great Recession". For me, this seemed like a very interesting
data set to see what kind of relationship, if any, would be revealed between birth rate and the state of the economy (using unemployment rate as a proxy).

During the process of analyzing the natality data, I created the following geographic heatmap to help me understand the relative changes in birth rate
around the United States during the time frame. It presents the birth rate per 1000 people by county throughout the continental United States.

I used R and various R modules including ggplot and ggmap to analyze the data and document my findings.  The complete R Markdown code is available on GitHub
if you would like to dig in and see the analysis in detail or attempt to reproduce my results. Links to the final paper as well as my GitHub repository 
are listed in the Links section below.
