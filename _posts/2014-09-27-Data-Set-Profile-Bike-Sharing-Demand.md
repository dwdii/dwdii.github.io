As you may know I recently started pursuing my [Master of Science, Data Analytics](http://bit.ly/cunymsda) at the [City University of New York (CUNY)](http://www.cuny.edu). 
One of the courses I am taking currently uses the [R language](http://r-project.org) among other technologies to acquire, clean and analyze various data set. During one
of my projects I chose to analyze the bike sharing rental data set which is part of the [Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand).

I have shared the analysis paper in a number of different locations on the Internet for convienence. Enjoy!
