On June 20, 2016, Microsoft released a preview of their [Microsoft.Phoenix.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Phoenix.Client/) 
on Nuget.org. This package provides a .NET framework compatible collection
of classes to interface with the [Apache Phoenix Query Server](https://phoenix.apache.org/) for [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/). 
I had been evaluating Phoenix and HBase in the prior weeks and the release of the .NET client library was very interesting to me. It was the only
.NET compatible client I was aware of and I immediately began experimenting with it.

As I began learning how to use the Microsoft.Phoenix.Client, I noticed the use of [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
and discovered the underlying wire protocol relied on Protocol Buffers also. As it turns our Apache Phoenix uses 
[Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/), and specifically [Avatica](https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/), 
at the network layer to facilitate the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) interface.

The [Microsoft.Phoenix.Client's project site](https://github.com/Azure/hdinsight-phoenix-sharp), hosted on GitHub, has some great examples 
of using the `PhoenixClient`. I also found [duoxo's](https://github.com/duoxu) [tweet-sentiment-phoenix](https://github.com/duoxu/tweet-sentiment-phoenix)
project to have some great examples. As I worked though my first use case, I was missing the good old 
[IDbConnection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.idbconnection(v=vs.110).aspx) et al paradigm implemented for so many
relational database providers. SqlConnection, OracleConnection, etc. Wouldn't it be great if there was a PhoenixConnection?

With a resounding "yes!", I started the `PhoenixConnection` class, which led to the `PhoenixCommand` and then `PhoenixDataReader` classes. 
Along with these classes came the familiar `ConnectionString` property on the `PhoenixConnection` class. After working through most of the
interfaces, it became possible for me to open a connection to Apache Phoenix and execute queries from my code in a manner virtually every .NET 
developer is familiar with:

{% highlight csharp %}
using (IDbConnection phConn = new PhoenixConnection())
{
    phConn.ConnectionString = cmdLine.ConnectionString;

    phConn.Open();

    using (IDbCommand cmd = phConn.CreateCommand())
    {
        cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM GARUDATEST";
        using (IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
        {
            while(reader.Read())
            {
                for(int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0}: {1}", reader.GetName(i), reader.GetValue(i)));
                }
            }
        }
    }                        
}
{% endhighlight %}

It seemed apparent that these APIs would be useful to other .NET developers who needed to interface with big data stored
in Apache Phoenix/HBase. I decided to prepare a Nuget package which I named Garuda.Data, after 
[the mythical bird from Hindu and Buddhist traditions, the Garuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda), and uploaded an
early "alpha" version to nuget.org in late July.

The Garuda.Data package has been updated several times since the original alpha release. As of the time of this writing, it is in beta (v0.5.6067.42547)
and includes:

* `PhoenixBulkCopy` class which takes advantage of the 
[ExecuteBatchRequest](https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/docs/protobuf_reference.html#executebatchrequest) mechanism for more
efficient inserts/updates (UPSERTS in Phoenix SQL). 
* `PhoenixTransaction` class enables traditional transactional commit/rollback 
using the [Phoenix Transactions](https://phoenix.apache.org/transactions.html) functionality.
* Compatibility with .NET DataTable and DataGridView 

The Garuda.Data project is part of a solution, GarudaUtil, which includes a graphical user interface for connecting to and querying
Apache Phoenix using the Garuda.Data library.
